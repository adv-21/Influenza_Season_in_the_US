# Influenza_Season_in_the_US
##Project Overview
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. This analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine historical trends in influenza related deaths and influenza vaccinations to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country. 
##Goals
● Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timingand spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.\
● Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?\
● Create a staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without necessitating additional resources and with minimal instances of understaffing and overstaffing across states
